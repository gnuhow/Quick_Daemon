A collection of IETF & IANA MIBs
--------------------------------

This is a set of IETF & IANA MIBs pre-compiled and packaged to
simplify their use with the PySNMP library.

All these files were autogenerated from ASN.1 MIB files using
ether build-pysnmp-mib or rebuild-pysnmp-mibs tools. The
former is distributed with pysnmp package while the latter
with this pysnmp-mibs one. 

For more information, please, refer to PySNMP project homepage at
